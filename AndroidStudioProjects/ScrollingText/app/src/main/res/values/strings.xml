6:20:24 AM So it\&#39;s been a long time now since i have been journaling regularly. I decided to start a new one. maybe this will help me out some. things really go better when im journaling. I have been studying Zen some in the mean time. im trying to get things in the flow. will this help? maybe. im starting russian lessons again. i was crazy about facebook for a while but that has settled some. i remember writing about dad\&#39;s death some in the last part of the last journal. stopped in for some expression there but it was not regular journaling. I feel like i write too much and who could ever read all of this stuff but its good just to write some stuff down i think. i have to get busy with my guitar too. i continue to try to improve there but i dont have a regular routine with it either. so here it is, the new journal.... i have to get with my memories and feelings too but i am doing very well in that regard since i have been working on this stuff for the last several years. i am still haunted by some of my past nightmares but really i feel very good about what i have done so far. my faith has increased too i think. i have studied some buddhism and very glad for it but i still have my faith... doing well. buddhism... not a problem for me and my faith.

02:44:13 AM So i did not do much journaling yesterday. had a good day getting around with my sister and completed a few of my tasks for praying and meditation and study. i feel like i have some avoidant issues with the journal for feeling the way i felt the last time that i wrote here which was when my dad was dying. kind of strange feeling and not good times really. good to be finding my feelings but not comfortable. have recently encountered my desire to learn russian again and touching on those times before mom died and also when we were finding out about the cancer. its early in the morning and i feel guilty for being up but im here and im trying to just let things go.... im trying to prioritize my objectives by considering them all equally and well im up and want to do something so here i am. should i reallly feel guilty or just go with my feelings and ambitions? im not sure about my ambitions ... trying to reduce my ego and find real true humility and just let things happen but maybe i should stop valuing sleep during these early hours. a lot of creative people use these hours to do some of their best work. well anyway i have some reading to do and i wanted to stop in here to the journal too. not sure when im going to read but i have guitar ambitions and i have trading coming up soon. hoping to make some livelihood out of trading... could be trading again as soon as next week. so im going to be doing prayers and meditations and i think i will make some effort to write some thoughts and feelings here as well.
2:49
10:00AM so there is this young woman at FSS where i get my therapy. she has got my attention and as of last thursday im finding that im kind of feeling strongly about her. so here it goes again, there is some really good chemistry there but i dont know if she is with someone or not but in any case she seems to be opening up to me.... i want to fall right in but my reflexive reactions are avoidant in spite of my feelings. so we keep finding ourselves in this little dance of the sexes. curious to see what will come next. she does kind of remind me of Bolton who has moved away from there since i journaled before. in any case... i wonder if i missed out on something with bolton for being to avoidant of my sexual feelings and what now? there is kathy out there still too and from time to time i find that im still intrigued with her but im not pursuing anything except that she sees my facebook posts and i know it. what to do with this now im torn between two potentials. finally im finding this just right to realize how i truly am... fickle and undeveloped at heart. i always thought monogamy should be a given but it is not.. if it truly exists i think it must be something that has to be developed and disciplined.

4:29AM having difficulty in my meditations... and in sleeping. have recently discovered some unreconciled memories from woodward and trying to quit smoking. i thought i might write about it some to get things progressing but here i am and i feel like im done... without mentioning details. in any case have not journaled in a while and thought iw ould try this. i will probably write more later.
4:30
4:57 terry used to choke me with his fingers.. stopping me from crying out to mom. it was terrifying. remmbering these things today and relaizing how intens was terry\&#39;s puninhsmenrllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllls bak then thnad now realizing its a  dephinity thingk&gt;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
4:59
11:07 i tried writing some this morning. im struggling through this day but im making it. im trying to cut back and quit on smoking too. feeling more optimistic about this now that im considering my dad in the complex emotions of my addiction.

dealing with some strange feelings in meditation and very uncomfortable but its these same feelings that have kept me from getting much sleep in the past couple of days. finding those feelings developing here as i sit at the terminal and i reflexively avoid them but they are surfacing and im having to deal with them.

going to take some time and get back to meditation but so glad for the time i spen in meditation even if it is somewhat uncomfortable at times.
11:12
11:51 im sore and im thinking of doing yoga again. feeling my pain in my lungs and all through my body but it feels good to stretch at last. i have bronchitis. i have had it for years. not feeling well.  im going to los the smoking habit. there is much in it for me to lose by now and i cant help feeling down about it but its going to be a really good thing if i can really quit smoking.
11:52
12:41 so i just had a cigarette. im only getting by with about 20-40 minutes between cigarettes but i feel like that is an improvement. i want to do better. they make me feel bad and i think meditation will start getting better without them. also i am sick and in part is because i smoke. i would do better to not smoke and its just going to be good to be free of them..  none the less im sad to be losing something. feeling loss and ok i have to accept loss too and then what? looking to rearrange my feelings and my life without cigarettes.. looking to dad in my past but having to realize he is gone now and in some ways he was gone before he died in our relationship the way that i look for it there in the past.
12:44
7:15 this day and in recent days i am facing a great deal of fear. much of my life shadowed by this fear i think. i think i have to relearn how to deal with fear. i suppose i was taught to suppress these feelings and today im realizing i can realize and validate them even if i dont want to. its these feeling that i wont let in that are waking me in the night and keeping me up.

Sunday August 27 2017
11:52Am here it is summer come and gone. had some success in trading but hten the markets went sour or rather kind of dried up. looking forward to getting into trading some better markets and have taken out the summer doing other things. hope to get some money one of these days. im dealing with my mental and emotional issues though. dissociatvie disorder. taking it more seriously. thinking of cindy today and recent days im remembering randy too. remember going out to eat with mom and dad and shane and randy. nice to remember.
deep feelings. still need a dentist. im really afraid of the dentist but right now i cant afford it either. looking seriously at all of my phobias and still dealing with fear. have read several books on zen and i really appreciate the koan books... they hit me and make me grow stronger.. looking forward to some more of that but have recently read the haunted self again and im really struck with the reality of severe psychological trauma and its life long and devastating affects. sentimental and sad and scared i thought i might stop and write a bit here in the journal. fearing social again. i never get far with social. some of my fears. getting right i think...it hurts so much really. i might stop by here later today. i dont really know. i do kind of want to just run away. feeling a little sad and desperate. getting in touch with a lot of my dissociated parts recently and finding that one little guy that would just rather die sometiems.
11;57

12:10 how could i deny it but i think im facing a mountain of grief this morning. taking on randy and did i think there would be no grief there? its coming around 2 years since my mom died as wll and died died recently. started to cry just as i was reading back to january around those tragice times with my dad before writing today. finding agnry feelings and bitter feelings and it just seems i will always be finding these feelings.. but my grandma foresman died and death seems so unfair and really what a terrible blow with losing tracey. god i love her so much. seeing a lot of grief in my life and its really not a bad signe to be seeing many losses all in one now. things are coming together. losing tracey and cindy too and so much grief for the tragic responses to tragedy in my life. grieving my disorder. not sure how to grieve... im angry and telling myself just don&#39;t be angry. its a part of life and one day we will die too.. everything dies. i dont know where the logic is in that and its not a logic problem for me but maybe there is peace in accepting it... we all die.... that makes me angry.... well that depresses me and wll then maybe one day soon i can accept that... maybe then there will be peace unlike anything i hve yet known. where is the logic... its just processing. dont get stuck and keep it coming.
12:15

1:04 i guess i have been kind of deep in grief and denial for about a week now. maybe a little longer. feeling need for connection and desperately lonely. feeling a little better to recognize it. but i thought i was done with grief and im always so anxious to be done with it in total. maybe there is not any getting over it completely but i have not given up yet. i always want to take shortcuts and say im done when ya know im not. i have a lot of losses to grieve for with so  much negligence about these things throughout my life. ingorance too. i didnt know what to do and i found it easier to dissociate from grief than to have to deal with it and often that is what i would do... having the capacity..its like an easy crutch and here i am today with a load of it on my back. good and so getting through it but i wont be done until i can see it all at once i think.

8:32 Its evening this saturday and finding my way back to the journal again. have been finding interest in kathy recently but then there was a bombshell of a nice little woman at FSS a week or so back and she was interested but i couldnt get byeond myself saying no an no way and is it fear or is it just that like it or not im not ready for her. i want to just dive in and go for it with her though. it was really nice in her presence. i think her name was kayla... what coincedence. it seems i have seen her once before but can i be sure that was the same person... very striking to me anyway. i regret not having held on a little to get her name and contact info.

deep feelings... processing deep and looking around quite a but. there is grief and then ya know there is trauma... im working a little more with parts and right now im working with the one i call 12.... perhaps better adjusted about alicia than most of us but he is right there with it. he likes tolkien and dungeons and dragons and we are looking aroun dmy life some and looking back to the drowning some too. its really terrifying. i guess i was looking at deep fear with terry choking and smothering me too.. i guess i had forgotten about all fo that recently since having encounter on facebook with linda marsh. i guess i have not written much about that either but it was  a switchihng event for me. here i am now studying dissociative disorder and being very sensitive but tyring to get back to zen and more too. losing interest in facebook. i should find a way to hook up with kathy some other way. i worry she might be falling for me and i often worry that i might be falling for her honestly. why is she not like the other girls... there is always something im not sure about with her. other girls inspire fear but sometimes its just so very on and i want to go and then im reaching and then im struggling. not all other girls but these are the ones that hold me.
8:39
9:46 and i have done some meditation since last here. it feels good to be hear. im looking at my life and its like the past is decimated. looking around now. its ok really im just letting go but its so quiet and still. there are signs of life. sure there are emotions and attachments. letting go some and i feel like running away but making my self stay up to face it some.  think i have a habit of running away in going to bed and then i have phobias as im sleeping. I used to look back at my life and try to restore or salvage something from this forgotten past and im sure i must be holding on still but beginning to see it and just let it all go. letting go of FBI and CIA and any hopes of reconciling with those agencies. sure there might be memories but even that is all over and done by now. I&#39;m not the master of my life. i need to share with parts and i need to realize... im very deficient with me alone as master. trying to get right with god and jesus and buddha too. and then you remember Jung has a concept of Self that i need to reconcile with as well. i guess the final question is Who am I and then what if i just let go some there too and accept whatever might be there.

‎Tuesday, ‎September ‎12, ‎2017
11:45 it\&#39;s late. have slept a little already. i didnt sleep at all last night. slept some during the day but im really tired now. whats going on? emotional. working with my past some. finished reading zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. good book really. not sure what i have to say right now. feeling around the place to get familiar i thin. it feels like i have been out for a while. remembering dad.  my self is changing. i should accept change.... i strive for stability but the true self is dynamic. i am more so as a dissociative person and then again i have too many dualistic distinctions of self.
11:47
‎Friday, ‎September ‎15, ‎2017
9:24 its late again. near bed time. not sure if that has th meaning that it once had for me. i dont sleep very regular hours any more. spend the day reading and practicng guitar. finished a book by sam harris. im exploring faith and mysticism. religion and spirituality and psychology. i have decided to start taking my dissociative symptoms and indicated condition much more seriously. the field is progressing too with some new books on the treatment of these disorders. surely i have been truamatized. i have been addressing these memories as a single I. i think now i should take these meomries up with the various parts of my self that i find myself spending my time with. others will come into constallation as time goes on i think and perhaps i may yet discover new ones but taking the time to integrate and share memoreis with them should be very good. i orders some new books on treating and coping with dissociative disorder. i have one coming on attachment issues in adults too. im still looking into buddhism and my quest for the self there as well as with Jung. I wonder why god is so silent? he just is the stillest and smallest and not the boisterous ominous thing that we sometimes imagine him to be. i have been hearing from modern atheism about him and its not good in their final judgements. i have to reread and reinterpret from the old testament but its clear to me that they are not being quit complete or fair in their estimation of him. they may be taking some of the common misconceptsion that are promulgated by the various church traditions as well. I&#39;m not alright with all of the traditional views of the churches myself but i have not yet abandoned this god of my childhood.
feeling emotional and sentimental as i come to the journal tonight. there is feeling of sadness and loss and i think im thinking of my mother and father a bit more lately. im losing a tooth or two as well and thats really depressing too. i feel like in these losses im becoming leaner and more prepared for the kingdom of heaven though... but sad and sorry and even a little bitter to accept them. the sooner to acceptance the better i thin. I&#39;m putting a lot of faith in this kingdom of heaven talked about by jesus. i have seen evidence of it in my dreams and visions i think and could it be just as significant and real as this outer reality that we realists have so much faith in? i really think so. its one world inner and outer and not at all separate in my way of belieiving.  these days i wonder what was the true message of the gospels. modern churches distill and refine it to just one simple message. Jesus died for your sins. i thinik there is more to it than that as important as that in itself may be. i really feel cheated and i feel that the churches have been missing the larger points for a long time now. do they even know the significance of communion and suffering and the saving powers that we possess within our minds and bodies? do they not see what we are called to do in suffering for the sins of all of creation towards the restoration of all things; participating in the work of salvation?
